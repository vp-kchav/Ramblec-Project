# Ramblec-Project

* starting from Ramblec.java and you have to implement java code and using Swing controls(textBox, button...etc) learn how to add them from your lecture or  https://www.guru99.com/java-swing-gui.html or https://www.javatpoint.com/java-swing
* what you have to do is to make the GUI which looks exactly the same as Figure 17-3
* I already created the necessary class according to the the Diagram (Figure 17-4)
* you can try by yourself adding those controls and do some research form books or the link I above.
